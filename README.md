This is an [Odin](https://odin-lang.org) implementation of the game [Dominions](https://mindsports.nl/index.php/the-pit/526-dominions). Hobby work.

A writeup about the project and its evolution can be found [on my site](https://asibahi.github.io/thoughts/the-garden-of-odin/)

Christian Freeling has done me the kindness of mentioning the article and repo on [the Boardgame Geek Forums](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3361004/the-garden-of-odin). Yay!
